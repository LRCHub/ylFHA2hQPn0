Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Keep getting much of you
When I give you the best of me
Maybe my love is just too much
Can't get enough of you, no, no
But you won't set me free
You want me the more I don't show up
When I'm ready, you're not ready
Tryna carry this love
And it's heavy, yeah
I'm obsessed, you're not sure
If I love you less, will you love me more?
I go back, you come forth
If I love you less, will you love me more?
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Wasting my breath, 'cause you like it better whе
n there's none lеft
When I'm not in your bed, only time you want me
there
But I want you so bad, gonna give everything
that I have
This is how you should hold me up
I'm obsessed, you're not sure
If I love you less, will you love me more?
I go back, you come forth
If I love you less, will you love me more?
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
When I'm ready, you're not ready
Tryna carry this love
And it's heavy, yeah
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
(If I love you less, will you love me more?)
Ooh-ooh
(If I love you less, will you love me more?)
