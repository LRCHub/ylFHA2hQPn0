Crash land with a sad smile
This sacrifice is it worth the while?
I watched my skin turn to nails
This bittersweet broken trail

Everybody knows
Everybody sees
Everybody all except me
Even though it hurts
When you think it's gonna work
It just gets worse

I tried my best to love you less
I tried my best I tried my best
The more we loved the more we wept
I tried my best to love you less

We fell down the lovers well
Drank the water got drunk as hell
See our spark it's infinite
Way beyond the universe

Everybody knows
Everybody sees
Everybody all except me
Even though I want to try
I could never bring myself to say goodbye

I tried my best to love you less
I tried my best I tried my best
The more we loved the more we wept
I tried my best to love you less

Sacrificing
What I thought was Paradise
This falling could be dangerous
I couldn't love you less
But I tried my best

I tried my best to love you less
I tried my best I tried my best
The more we loved the more we wept
I tried my best to love you less

I tried my best to love you less
I tried my best I tried my best
The more we loved the more we wept
I tried my best to love you less
