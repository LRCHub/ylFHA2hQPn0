Tell me where to go
Where it can't follow me
Shaking shadows like ours
Is harder than it seemed at first
Truth is, I don't want it to change
I'm full of bad decisions
And mistakes
My body collapses
And I'm falling back
And I'm in your arms again

I've been running from you
But I lost my breath
I've been pulling the brakes trying to love you less
And I know I should take a second guess
But I can't love you less
Love you less
Love you less
I've been running by from you
But I'm out of breath
I've been pulling the brakes trying to love you less
And I know I should take a second guess
But I can't love you less
Love you less
Love you less

Tell me can you feel
Is there a storm inside of you?
What it gonna leave behind
This thunder passing through
Me and you
Truth is, I don't want it to go away
Got a bad conscience
It's just something I say
My body collapses
And I'm falling back
And I'm in your arms again

I've been running from you
But I lost my breath
I've been pulling the brakes trying to love you less
And I know I should take a second guess
But I can't love you less
Love you less
Love you less
I've been running by from you
But I'm out of breath
I've been pulling the brakes trying to love you less
And I know I should take a second guess
But I can't love you less
Love you less
Love you less

I'm outta breath
Trying to love you less
I second guess
Love you less
Love you less
Love you less
I'm outta breath
Trying to love you less
I second guess
Love you less
Love you less
Love you less
